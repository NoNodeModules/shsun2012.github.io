### About me

Various interests. Admire innovative creators. Skilled in digital painting. Playing Pipa (traditional Chinese string instrument) for many years but now more into guitar, as more fingerstyle tabs available. 

Used to be interested in learning language, and once tried to learn Cantonese with no idea that I actually came to Hong Kong!
