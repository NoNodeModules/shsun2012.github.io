My first attempt to make a 2D platform game with Unity was back in 2016. The first chapter of this game was recorded [here on Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av4137891).

I used C# following online tutorials and created some assets, colliders, prefebs, layers, animations and everything. The character tiles were painted in a pixel style with PhotoShop, while some tree tiles were from pixel art resources. After I figured out the general framework of the game and how to connect different levels, I stuck at a point when I started writing character dialogue: What is the story? What do you want to convey to the players?  

I thought to create a game about a shiba dog woke up one morning, realizing that it was a dog and began to seek the cure. Then the shiba went through different levels and adventure stuff, in the campus (yes that's the background setting), and finally found the magic to transfrom back to human.  

I've learned a lot and tried many things. I made a 3D fluffy shiba with Blender, a wonderful 3D creation software. Then I found it was too complicated to make a 3D game, with only myself. Then the most realistic choice was to make an ordinary 2D platform game. Anyway, it's the story that matters. The sad thing was, I don't have the energy for creating a wonderful story and the motivation for finishing the entire game, as I was to graduate and things happened.  

It's still amazing to see that I was so eager to learn so many things in a short time period, just to show off :joy::joy::joy:
