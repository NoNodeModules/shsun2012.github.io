I used to read paper books. Then I started using Kindle. Now I use Audible for its convenience. It is like compromising step by step. When I was little, I loved to sit there and listen to cassette tape stories with full attention. Audible reminds me of tapes. However, different from childhood addiction to story books, now it is time for self help books. I just use up monthly credits for two free books and audible originals, which in total 4 books.
