I used to be a Sherlock fan and created some fan art works for the community. People around the world can share a connection through a picture, a video, an article or any form of fan arts, and they were usually nice and supportive, which was really amazing.

I used Creative Cloud for many softwares such as PhotoShop, Premiere and Animate. I also tried other Adobe products like Character Animator, which can track your emotions and mouth movements to help easier animations. I used After Effects to make a video intro (though I never make videos after that).

I was inspired by some Russian Youtubers that made fanvids: [by pingvi](https://www.youtube.com/user/smska1995/videos?disable_polymer=1), KatrinDepp and Pteryx. Then I tried best to edit my own vids, using Vegas Pro at first, a free video editting software. Later I started using Premiere Pro, which was supposed to be more professional. Then I got some views. There's a map that you can check where your viewers are from on YouTube. It was actually quite amazing to know that your videos had been viewed by people from places that you have never been to.  

Sometimes people left nice comments or just gave likes or hearts on YouTube or Tumblr. The most satisfying thing about making fan art is when you know that you do spread a little love and happiness to someone who you would never meet, and it's real.
