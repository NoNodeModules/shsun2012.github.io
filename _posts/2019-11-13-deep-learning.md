Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning and is also a hot topic nowadays. Three properties about deep learning: simplicity, scalability, versatility and reusability.

##### Neural Network  
Four types of real-world examples of data tensors are given:
* _Vector data_ - 2D tensors of shape
* _Timeseries data or sequence data_ - 3D tensors of shape
* _Images_ - 4D tensors of shape
* _Video_ - 5D tensors of shape
